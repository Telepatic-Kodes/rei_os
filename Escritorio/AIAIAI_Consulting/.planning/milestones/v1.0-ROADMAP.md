# Milestone v1.0: Operational Dashboard

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-30
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 5 (GSD-managed)

## Overview

Complete operational dashboard for monitoring development progress, token consumption, and code quality across 14 consulting projects in a monorepo.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Dashboard

**Goal**: Build the core dashboard with all monitoring views and organize the monorepo.
**Plans**: Pre-GSD (built before GSD initialization)

**Success criteria:**
- Next.js app runs with home, projects, tokens, quality pages
- 14 projects organized under projects/
- JSON data layer serves all views
- Claude Code fully configured

**Status:** Complete — all 17 requirements delivered.

### Phase 2: Kanban Board

**Goal**: Add interactive kanban view for visual project management.
**Plans**: Pre-GSD (built before GSD initialization)

**Success criteria:**
- Kanban page with 3 status columns
- Drag & drop moves projects between columns
- Sidebar navigation includes kanban link

**Status:** Complete — PROJ-03, PROJ-04 delivered.

### Phase 3: Data Persistence & Detail Pages

**Goal**: Make the dashboard read-write and add per-project deep views.
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 03-01: Kanban status persistence (PATCH API + optimistic UI)
- [x] 03-02: Sync projects script (git log + package.json)
- [x] 03-03: Per-project detail pages with tabs

**Status:** Complete — PROJ-05, INFR-04, INFR-05 delivered.

### Phase 4: Auto-sync & Integrations

**Goal**: Connect to external data sources for real metrics.
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 04-01: Token sync script (Anthropic Admin API)
- [x] 04-02: Quality sync script (coverage, lighthouse, TODO/FIXME)

**Status:** Complete — TOKN-04, QUAL-03 delivered.

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- JSON over database (simple, git-trackable) — ✓ Good
- Server Components with fs reads (no API layer needed) — ✓ Good
- HTML5 drag & drop (no extra deps) — ✓ Good
- Optimistic UI with revert on failure for kanban persistence (D-0301-01)
- Use __dirname over import.meta.dirname for tsx CJS compatibility (dec-0302-1)
- Tabs for detail page organization (Resumen/Timeline/Metricas) (D-0303-01)
- Link on name only for kanban cards to avoid drag conflict (D-0303-02)
- Graceful exit 0 without credentials for sync scripts (D-0401-01)
- Session-based merge strategy for token sync (D-0401-02)
- techDebt derivation from coverage+lighthouse thresholds (D-0402-01)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Kanban changes don't persist (visual only) — RESOLVED in 03-01
- All data manually maintained in JSON files — PARTIALLY RESOLVED in 03-02
- No connection to real APIs — RESOLVED in 04-01

**Issues Deferred:**

- GitHub integration for commit/PR stats (v2 scope)
- Automated quality scoring pipeline (v2 scope)
- Token budget alerts (v2 scope)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Sync scripts require manual execution (no cron/webhook yet)
- Token sync requires env vars that may not be configured
- No active sidebar state indicator
